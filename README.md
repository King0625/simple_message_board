This message_board is just one of my practice in vallina php based on my one-month-long learning experience. It contains a member system with image uploading function and a message system with reply features. In addition, my member system contains facebook graph-api OAuth just in order to learn how to read the third-party api docs.

Furthermore, there are some database infos and api keys in this project. As a consequence, I also try to learn how to implement .gitignore to hide the files with some secret stuffs in it.

(P.S. Since this is my php practice, it contains very little css, so the UI may be kind of terrible XD)
